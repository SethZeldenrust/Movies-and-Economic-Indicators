# Movies-and-Economic-Indicators
In this project, we used data from the Internet Movie Data Base data set and compared it against multiple economic indicators, such as CPI, unemployment rate, and gas prices. We started with a large dataset of all movies and television shows from 1894 to present and isolated movies between the years 2002-2009 through the use of SQL in DB Browser. We then combined that data with economic data spanning the same time period. Using data visualization programs like Orange and Powerbi, we analyzed whether economic factors such as CPI, unemployment, and gas prices were correlated with total movie grosses in both economic growth and recession periods.
